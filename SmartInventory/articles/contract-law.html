                <h2>Understanding Contracts and Legal Agreements</h2>
                <p>Contract law governs the enforcement of agreements between parties. It provides the legal framework for business transactions, personal agreements, and commercial relationships.</p>
                
                <h3>Elements of a Valid Contract</h3>
                <p>For a contract to be legally enforceable, it must contain these essential elements:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Offer:</strong> One party makes a clear proposal to another</li>
                    <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> The other party agrees to the terms of the offer</li>
                    <li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Something of value exchanged between parties</li>
                    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> All parties must have the legal ability to enter into contracts</li>
                    <li><strong>Legality:</strong> The contract's purpose must be legal</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Types of Contracts</h3>
                <p>Contracts can be categorized in several ways:</p>
                
                <h4>By Formation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Express Contracts:</strong> Terms are explicitly stated orally or in writing</li>
                    <li><strong>Implied Contracts:</strong> Terms are inferred from the parties' conduct</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>By Performance</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Executed Contracts:</strong> All parties have fulfilled their obligations</li>
                    <li><strong>Executory Contracts:</strong> Some obligations remain to be performed</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>By Validity</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Valid Contracts:</strong> Meet all legal requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Void Contracts:</strong> Have no legal effect</li>
                    <li><strong>Voidable Contracts:</strong> Can be canceled by one party</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Contract Performance and Breach</h3>
                <p>Parties to a contract are expected to perform their obligations as agreed. When a party fails to perform, it may constitute a breach of contract.</p>
                
                <h4>Types of Breach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Material Breach:</strong> Significant failure that defeats the contract's purpose</li>
                    <li><strong>Minor Breach:</strong> Failure that doesn't substantially defeat the contract's purpose</li>
                    <li><strong>Anticipatory Breach:</strong> One party indicates they will not perform before the time for performance</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Remedies for Breach</h3>
                <p>When a contract is breached, several remedies may be available:</p>
                
                <h4>Monetary Damages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compensatory Damages:</strong> Compensation for actual losses</li>
                    <li><strong>Consequential Damages:</strong> Compensation for indirect losses</li>
                    <li><strong>Punitive Damages:</strong> Punishment for wrongful conduct (rare in contract law)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Equitable Remedies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Specific Performance:</strong> Court order to perform the contract</li>
                    <li><strong>Injunction:</strong> Court order to stop certain actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Rescission:</strong> Cancellation of the contract</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Contract Interpretation</h3>
                <p>Courts use various principles to interpret contracts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plain Meaning Rule:</strong> Terms are given their ordinary meaning</li>
                    <li><strong>Parol Evidence Rule:</strong> Oral agreements cannot contradict written contracts</li>
                    <li><strong>Contra Proferentem:</strong> Ambiguous terms are interpreted against the drafter</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Contract Defenses</h3>
                <p>Several defenses may excuse contract performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Duress:</strong> Contract entered under threat or coercion</li>
                    <li><strong>Undue Influence:</strong> Unfair persuasion by a party in a position of trust</li>
                    <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> False statements inducing contract formation</li>
                    <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> Mutual or unilateral error in contract terms</li>
                    <li><strong>Unconscionability:</strong> Contract terms that are extremely unfair</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Modern Contract Considerations</h3>
                <p>Contemporary contract law addresses new challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Electronic Contracts:</strong> Digital signatures and online agreements</li>
                    <li><strong>Click-Wrap Agreements:</strong> Terms accepted by clicking "I agree"</li>
                    <li><strong>International Contracts:</strong> Cross-border enforcement and jurisdiction</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Protection:</strong> Special rules for consumer contracts</li>
                </ul>
