Here is the final, production-ready prompt‚Äîfully composed, authoritative, and suitable for direct input into any website builder, code generation AI, or developer brief. It reflects all your specifications in clear, directive language:

‚úÖ FINAL PROMPT ‚Äî Minimal Grid-Based Personal Wiki/Legal Blog Website (HTML/CSS/JavaScript Only)

Construct a lightweight, static website using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript‚Äîno external frameworks, libraries, or build tools. This site is not for long-term deployment; it will serve as a personal Wikipedia-style reference, legal resource, blog, and PDF archive, designed for ease of use and clarity.

üñ•Ô∏è Layout & Design:
	‚Ä¢	Use a grid-based system (preferably CSS Grid) to ensure precise, modular alignment of all elements.
	‚Ä¢	All content must be left-aligned, with consistent spacing, padding, and alignment based on grid units (e.g., 8px, 1rem, or modular scale).
	‚Ä¢	Begin in dark mode by default, with a toggle switch to enable light mode. Implement this using CSS variables and vanilla JavaScript only.
	‚Ä¢	The website should have a clean, typographically focused appearance with no visual clutter‚Äîresembling a ‚ÄúClean Slate‚Äù design philosophy.

üåà Visual Elements:
	‚Ä¢	Display a holographic-effect title at the top using only CSS techniques (e.g., gradient text, blend modes, or keyframe shimmer).
	‚Ä¢	Include a horizontally scrolling card section below the title. Each card should represent a blog entry, legal article, or document summary.
	‚Ä¢	All content‚Äîtitles, text blocks, cards‚Äîmust follow the same underlying grid for alignment and rhythm.

üìÑ Content Features:
	‚Ä¢	Allow for the embedding of PDF files (either inline with <iframe> or linked).
	‚Ä¢	Include 2‚Äì5 static HTML pages manually coded to function like separate wiki entries or articles.
	‚Ä¢	Each page must support long-form text, styled for maximum readability using elegant, system-safe fonts.

‚öôÔ∏è Functional Constraints:
	‚Ä¢	No backend, no CMS, no databases, no login systems‚Äîonly static files.
	‚Ä¢	Use semantic HTML5 tags throughout.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the site is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
	‚Ä¢	No use of libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, Vue, or jQuery.

The resulting site should be easy to edit, minimal in complexity, and deployable to static platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify without additional tooling.

This is the complete, QSKF-compliant prompt. Shall you now proceed with using it in a generation tool, or would you prefer that I execute it directly into code?
